**CompTIA Security+ Certification Expected Jan 2026**

**COMPETITION**

**National Cyber League Fall 2024:** Experienced Team Game \[Placed 84/532\]

• Cracked passwords, investigated and exploited web applications, utilized open-source intelligence, performed digital forensics, analyzed network traffic, and executed log analysis. Utilized NMAP, Hashcat, Burpsuite, Wireshark, VM Virtual Box, Volatility memory dump analysis, etc.

• Developed write-ups for fellow competitors at university and explained problem solving workflow.

**EXPERIENCE**

**CSE 525 Microcomputer Systems Teaching Assistant | 20 Hrs/Week Aug 2024 - December 2024**

_University of Louisville, Speed School of Engineering_

• Duties include grading responsibilities of exams and lab reports, lab management, and the first line of defense for student questions.

• Class focus in the design, construction, and testing of an ARM-based microcomputer consisting of CPU, EEPROM (firmware), RAM, and various peripheral I/O devices. Students also gain an understanding of how to write bare-metal operating system kernels for an ARM architecture.

**Computer Science Engineering CO-OP I & II, Engineering Analysis | 40 Hrs/Week Jan 2023 – Aug 2023**

_Louisville Ikeyless and Car Keys Express_

• Designed internal fixture logic boards using Eagle CAD specifically built for each SKU of car key.

• Analyzed key press data transfers using a logic analyzer and Manchester decoding to capture important information for transponder and board pairing.

• Maintained internal devices written in C/C++, Python, and assembly, used in conjunction with unique fixtures to reprogram OEM key SKUs and identify transponders.

• Managed repair of hundreds of fixtures, while mitigating cost of new board printing, acrylic housing.

**PROJECTS**

**Capstone Engineering Project | Python Aug 2024– Dec 2024**

_Louisville Metro Department of Public Health and Wellness_

• Completed 15 weekly meetings with stakeholders and 4 students.

• Created a pipeline utilizing Louisville Metro’s Open Licensing database and Google Places API to store location data and user reviews for analysis. Kept API calls within Google’s free tier of 200$/Month.

• Utilized a GIS coordinate grid with variable sizing for population variance to enumerate hundreds of location results within specific bounds. Compiled a list of storefronts with a tobacco related place type (gas station, convenience store).

• Narrowed down to a final list of unlicensed candidates by analyzing reviews for a list of tobacco related keywords using Natural Language Processing, lemmatization to process and compare Google Place Reviews.

• Presented results to stakeholders utilizing ARC GIS as a GUI to visually represent hotspots of both licensed and unlicensed locations.

**City Navigational Routing Problem | neo4j June 2024– July 2024**

• Utilized Open Street Map’s API to capture a node relationship snapshot file describing an urban environment’s street relationships

• Loaded data into a Neo4j graph database to be used as the GUI layer. Submitted SQL based queries to perform Dijkstra’s algorithm between any two nodes to identify the shortest walking path on city streets for user navigation.

**Video Stream Common Object Detection | Python March 2024– April 2024**

• Inspired by the Comon Object in Context (COCO) published pre-trained model, based on the Mobilenet v3 neural network architecture, with a similar target use case in mind. Used OpenCV and libcamera commands in python to utilize the Raspberry Pi and its camera peripheral.

• Due to computational restrictions, reduced video stream framerate so matrix operations could keep up with real time data.

• Final output described all recognized objects in frame above a certain confidence level, with a confidence score and box for identification.

**Machine Learning Image Classification | Python November 2024– December 2024**

• Given a size 10k dataset describing images in 1 of 5 categories. Each row describes a 32x32 image with color. Leveraged the Scikit-learn library for analysis. Performed clustering and silhouette plot analysis to examine model overlap performance.

• Identified core samples from each cluster and plotted the PCA visualization of our K-means clusters VS that of the ground truth labels while analyzing the Adjusted Rand Index

• later tested classification performance of Gradient Boosted Regression Trees, Random Forest, and SVM while utilizing cross validation, and comparing prediction results via confusion matrix.
